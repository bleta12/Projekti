   <h2>Behind the history of SELL ART</h2>
    <p>The page "SELL ART" was created at the end of 2023 and the beginning of 2024. <br>
      Although it is new in its creation, its history dates back to the early years, when everything began to take on the colors and forms that were previously known to us  they seemed meaningless, they began to take their colors, the shape changed, although now it seems useless, then it seemed as if everything that surrounded us began to sing together with the birds in the branches of the trees, which seemed to say, "Everything is falling in its place. <br>
      These were the first strands of art that began to reveal the artistic talents that surrounded us.
      The purpose of this site is mainly to sell the paintings of the greatest artists of all time, but at the same time it offers knowledge about the paintings of the artists, the history, the inspiration behind them, as well as the beginnings of the artists.</p>
